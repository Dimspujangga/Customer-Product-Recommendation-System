This project aims to create a customer product recommendation system based on customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. By analyzing customer transaction data, we segment customers into distinct groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized product recommendations. This approach enhances the potential for increased engagement and sales by tailoring suggestions to each customer segment.

CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE :

Please note that due to data confidentiality, only the segmentation results, customer profiling, and a sample of the recommendation columns are shared in this project. Other detailed insights and data are withheld to protect customer privacy. For a more detailed overview or specific insights, please reach out directly.

Introduction :

In competitive markets, understanding customer preferences and behaviors is crucial. This project aims to create a product recommendation system by leveraging customer segmentation, allowing for personalized recommendations based on clustering. The system uses a machine learning-based approach to group similar customers and recommend relevant products, improving the customer experience and driving sales.

Objectives :
1. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure accurate and efficient clustering.
2. Feature Engineering: Develop new features based on transactional data, creating a comprehensive, customer-centric dataset as the foundation for segmentation.
3. Data Preprocessing: Implement feature scaling and dimensionality reduction techniques to streamline the data and optimize the clustering process.
4. Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering: Segment customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering, enabling targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
5. Cluster Analysis & Evaluation: Analyze and profile each cluster to develop targeted marketing strategies, and assess the quality of the clusters using evaluation metrics.
6. Recommendation System: Implement a recommendation system to suggest best-selling products to customers within the same cluster who haven’t purchased those items, aiming to boost sales and improve marketing effectiveness.

Features :
1. Personalized Recommendations: Suggests products that are popular within each customer cluster to users who have yet to purchase them.
2. Customer Segmentation: Divides customers into distinct segments based on purchase behavior, transaction history, and spending patterns.
3. Cluster Profiling: Provides insights into each cluster’s characteristics, helping inform targeted marketing campaigns.
4. Real-Time Deployment: Deploy the recommendation system in a production environment to serve recommendations in real-time.
